    /* given input from challenge: 
        11 2 4
        4 5 6
        10 8 -12

        The left diagonal is 11, 5, -12
        The right diagonal is 4, 5, 10

        The sum of the left is 4, and the sum of the right is 15
        The absolute value of both is |4 - 19| = 15
        Math stuff: |x| is the absolute value of x
